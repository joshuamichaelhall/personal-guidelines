# Personal Guidelines

A private repository containing my personal standards, workflows, decision frameworks, and productivity systems.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a centralized location for my personal guidelines, providing:

- Consistent standards for personal and professional work
- Decision-making frameworks to reduce cognitive load
- Productivity systems and workflows
- Career development standards and metrics
- Personal documentation that spans multiple projects and repositories

Rather than reinventing processes or standards for each new project, this repository provides reference materials that can be applied consistently across all my work.
