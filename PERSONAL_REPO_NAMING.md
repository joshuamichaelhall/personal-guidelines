# Personal Repository Naming Conventions

This guide establishes naming conventions for personal repositories to maintain consistency with the JoshuaMichaelHall-Tech organization standards.

## Naming Prefixes

| Prefix | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `personal-` | Personal projects/configurations | `personal-dotfiles` |
| `fork-` | Modified forks of other repositories | `fork-tmux-config` |
| `blog-` | Blog content and website materials | `blog-articles` |
| `experiment-` | Experimental projects and learning | `experiment-rust-game` |
| `portfolio-` | Portfolio website components | `portfolio-site` |

## Technology-Specific Prefixes
Follow organization conventions for language-specific repositories:

| Prefix | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `ruby-` | Ruby language projects | `ruby-scripts` |
| `python-` | Python language projects | `python-utilities` |
| `js-` | JavaScript projects | `js-components` |
| `devenv-` | Development environment tools | `devenv-vim-config` |
| `ml-` | Machine learning projects | `ml-experiments` |

## Naming Guidelines

1. **Use lowercase** for all repository names
2. **Use hyphens** to separate words (not underscores or camelCase)
3. **Be descriptive** but concise
4. **Be consistent** with similar repositories
5. **Avoid generic names** like "test" or "project"

## Archiving Strategy

For repositories that are no longer active but should be preserved:
- Add `archived-` prefix to the repository name
- Update the README to indicate archive status and reason

## Forked Repositories

For forked repositories that you've modified:
- Use the `fork-` prefix if you've made substantial changes
- Otherwise, keep the original name for unmodified forks

## Legacy Repositories

For repositories created before these standards:
- Consider renaming if actively maintained
- Otherwise, document the legacy naming in the README
